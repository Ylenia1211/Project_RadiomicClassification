# Project_RadiomicClassification
Study on the classification of radiomic data radiomic data on tumour status in patients in patients with prostate carcinoma using variational autoencoder (VAE). In this project, the VAE model is used as an alternative to PCA for the selection of dataset features. Tumour classification results obtained using PCA in combination with ML models such as: KNN, SVM, Random Forest, Logit. Tumour status classification results using VAE+MPL are also processed. In addition, oversampling of the samples was carried out using the SMOTE technique (for creating new synthetic data based on the actuals), using a non-trivial target reconstruction strategy.
